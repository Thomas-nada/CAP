# Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not quoting original text exactly
   - The portal’s fuzzy matching is robust, but exact or near-exact quotations make automatic application more reliable.

2. Selecting fragmented text
   - Avoid selecting partial sentences that include surrounding markup or list markers; select clear sentence boundaries.

3. Large unrelated changes in one CAP
   - Keep CAPs focused. Large, sweeping edits make review and approval harder.

4. Missing metadata (deliberation end)
   - Include the deliberation end date or leave the default 30-day window so reviewers know timelines.

5. Uploading sensitive files as exhibits
   - Do not upload credentials, private keys, or personal data.

6. Forgetting to provide rationale
   - Provide a short rationale for each proposed change. It speeds consensus.

7. Relying solely on the portal without cross-checking
   - After submission, review the created GitHub issue and uploaded preview to ensure formatting and content match expectations.
