# CAP Template Guide

Use this template when drafting a CAP issue. The portal pre-fills much of this when you use the Wizard.

Title: Short, declarative summary (e.g., "CAP-###: Update amendment process for X")

Abstract:
A one-paragraph summary of the proposed change and why it matters.

Motivation:
Explain the problem the change addresses and its impact.

Structured Revisions (for each affected section):
- Section heading (e.g., "Article IV")
- Original text (quote)
- Proposed revision (full replacement text)
- Short rationale for the phrasing chosen

Supporting Exhibits:
- Attach diagrams, test cases, legal references, or implementation notes.

Metadata (example):
- License: CC-BY-4.0
- Deliberation End: YYYY-MM-DD (30 days from submission is typical)

<!-- DELIBERATION_END: 2026-02-28 -->

Notes
- Keep each proposed revision minimal and self-contained when possible.
- If multiple unrelated changes are proposed, consider separate CAPs for clarity.
