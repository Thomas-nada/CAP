# Creating a CAP in GitHub

This quick guide explains the recommended workflow for creating a CAP using the portal.

1. Open the Amendment Wizard
   - Use the "New CAP" entry in the top navigation or the "Amendment Wizard" button on the Dashboard.

2. Draft the CAP
   - Fill the title, abstract, motivation and add structured revisions using the selection tools.
   - Attach supporting exhibits (files) if needed.
   - The wizard helps you gather contextual revisions by selecting text from the constitution.

3. Submit to GitHub
   - When you submit, the portal will create the GitHub Issue, upload any exhibits, and (if relevant) generate a preview constitution file under `constitution/CAP Constructions`.
   - The portal shows a local preview immediately; GitHub may take a few seconds to list the uploaded preview file.

4. After submission
   - The CAP issue holds the canonical discussion thread. Share the issue link with stakeholders.
   - If you need to update the CAP draft, edit the issue or create a follow-up CAP revision.

Tips
- Use the selection preview in the sidebar to confirm selected text before adding it.
- Provide short, clear motivation and expected outcomes in the abstract.

Security / etiquette
- Avoid including private keys or credentials in exhibits or issue text.
- Keep submissions respectful and focused on governance improvements.
