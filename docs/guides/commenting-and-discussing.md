# Commenting and Discussing

Good discussions are focused, civil, and evidence-based. Use these guidelines when commenting on CAP issues:

- Be specific: quote the relevant text or reference the CAP section (e.g., “Article II, paragraph 3”).
- Use quotes and code blocks for clarity:

```
> Proposed change: Replace “must” with “should” in Article IV
```

- Stay on-topic: keep comments about the proposed amendment, evidence, or implementation details.
- Be constructive: explain trade-offs, suggest alternatives, and offer draft wording when possible.
- Use reactions for simple agreement/disagreement to keep threads easy to scan.

Moderation & civility
- Address ideas, not people.
- If a thread derails, move to a separate discussion or request a moderator to summarize.

Technical notes
- If you reference external material, include a short excerpt and a link.
- For technical or implementation questions, provide reproducible examples where helpful.
