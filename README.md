# CAP Portal — Cardano Constitutional Amendment Portal

A governance platform for managing Cardano Amendment Proposals (CAPs) and Constitutional Information Submissions (CIS). Built with vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and GitHub as the backend.

**Live:** https://cap-portal.onrender.com

---

## Features

- **Public read-only access** — anyone can browse proposals, view the constitution, and read guides without logging in
- **GitHub OAuth login** — log in with your GitHub account to submit proposals and add comments
- **Editor controls** — editors can manage lifecycle stages and signal labels (access managed via `editors.json`)
- **Proposal Registry** — list and Kanban views with full-text search and filtering
- **Constitution Viewer** — browse versions and compare diffs; select text to anchor CAP proposals
- **Amendment Wizard** — step-by-step guided form for creating CAPs and CIS submissions
- **Learning Hub** — guides and documentation for governance participants
- **Dark mode** — full light/dark theme support

---

## Authentication

The portal uses **GitHub OAuth** — no Personal Access Tokens required.

- Public visitors can browse everything without logging in
- Clicking "New CAP" or "Post Comment" prompts login
- Login redirects through GitHub OAuth and back to the portal automatically

The OAuth token exchange is handled by a small Flask gatekeeper service deployed at `https://cap-portal-auth.onrender.com`. This keeps the GitHub Client Secret server-side.

---

## Editors

Editors have additional controls on proposal detail pages (lifecycle stage management, signal labels, special handling flags).

The list of editors is maintained in **`editors.json`** in the root of the `Thomas-nada/cap` GitHub repo:

```json
["Thomas-nada", "another-editor"]
```

To add or remove editors, edit this file directly on GitHub. Changes take effect on the next login.

## Local Development

```bash
python dev-server.py
# Open: http://localhost:8765
```

The dev server serves the portal and handles ES6 module loading. OAuth login works on localhost because the GitHub OAuth app's callback URLs include `http://localhost:8765`.

> **Note:** The Render free tier gatekeeper sleeps after inactivity. On first login after a period of inactivity, the auth exchange may take 20–30 seconds. The portal shows a "Warming up auth server…" message during this time.

---

## Deployment

The portal is deployed as two Render services:

| Service | Type | URL |
|---------|------|-----|
| `cap-portal` | Static site | https://cap-portal.onrender.com |
| `cap-portal-auth` | Flask web service | https://cap-portal-auth.onrender.com |

The gatekeeper requires two environment variables set in Render:
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`

These come from the GitHub OAuth App registered at https://github.com/settings/developers.

---

## GitHub Repository Setup

The portal reads from and writes to `Thomas-nada/cap` on GitHub.

Required repo structure:
- Issues enabled (proposals are stored as GitHub Issues)
- Labels matching the lifecycle stages: `draft`, `submitted`, `review`, `consultation`, `revision`, `finalizing`, `ready`, `onchain`, `done`, `withdrawn`
- `constitution/` folder with at least one `.md` constitution file
- `editors.json` in the root listing GitHub usernames who have editor access

---

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules), Tailwind CSS, Marked.js, Lucide Icons
- **Backend:** GitHub REST API + GraphQL, Flask gatekeeper for OAuth
- **Auth:** GitHub OAuth 2.0 (web flow)
- **Hosting:** Render (static site + web service)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Blank page / module errors:**
- Must be served over HTTP (not `file://` protocol) — use `python dev-server.py`
- Clear browser cache and hard-reload (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Login doesn't work:**
- The gatekeeper may be cold-starting — wait 30 seconds and try again
- Check browser console for CORS errors; verify `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` are set in Render

**Not showing as editor:**
- Confirm your GitHub username is listed in `editors.json` in the `Thomas-nada/cap` repo
- Log out and back in — editor status is resolved at login time
