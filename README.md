The Cardano Constitution Amendment Proposals (CAP) repository contains two complementary types document:

- **Cardano Amendment Proposals (CAP):** Formal proposals to amend, clarify, or extend Cardano‚Äôs Constitution.
- **Constitution Issue Statements (CIS):** Structured descriptions of Constitution problems, ambiguities, or risks that require community attention and may guide future CAPs.

Together, **CAP and CIS form aid Cardano‚Äôs off-chain governance documentation**.  
They provide the foundation for constitutional amendments and transparent community deliberation.  
Because these documents are stored as Markdown files in a versioned repository, their history serves as the authoritative record of Cardano‚Äôs evolving governance system.

## üß≠ What is a CAP?

A [Cardano Amendment Proposal (CAP)](./CAP-0001) is a governance design document proposing changes, additions, or clarifications to Cardano‚Äôs Constitution or guardrails.

Each CAP:

- Proposes a constitutional amendment or standard.
- Describes the motivation, specification, and path to ratification.
- Undergoes open community discussion, editorial review, and eventual on-chain governance action.

> üìå CAPs do **not** themselves enact constitutional changes. They serve as the **community input layer** for governance actions that are ultimately ratified on-chain.

For new CAPs, a template is available here: [.github/CAP-TEMPLATE.md](.github/CAP-TEMPLATE.md)

## üß≠ What is a CIS?

A [Constitution Issue Statement (CIS)](./CIS-0001) is a formal document that articulates a constitutional problem, its context, and its impact.  
Where CAPs propose solutions, CISs **define the problems** those solutions aim to solve.

Each CIS:

- Provides historical and procedural context for a constitutional challenge.  
- Describes the problem‚Äôs scope, impact, and stakeholder relevance.  
- Lists open questions and potential directions for future CAPs.

CISs and CAPs are complementary: a single CIS may inspire multiple CAPs, and a CAP may address multiple CISs.

For more details, see [CIS-9999 ‚Äì Constitution Issue Statements](./CIS-9999).
