## Abstract

This proposal humorously suggests mandating that all Delegated Representatives (DReps) wear pink on Wednesdays as a unifying visual expression of solidarity, friendliness, and cultural cohesion across the Cardano governance ecosystem.  

While primarily symbolic, the proposed amendment aims to explore how light-hearted traditions can enhance community identity, increase engagement, and build shared culture within decentralized systems. It serves as a playful test case for how “soft guardrails” — voluntary norms that reinforce social connection — can contribute to the perceived approachability and visibility of governance participants.

---

## Motivation: Why is this CAP necessary?

Governance can often appear abstract or overly serious, creating barriers to engagement for newcomers. DReps play a central role in shaping Cardano’s future, but they are not always perceived as accessible or relatable by the wider community.  

This CAP proposes the introduction of a gentle, recurring ritual — wearing pink on Wednesdays — to reinforce the human and social dimension of governance. Inspired by the cultural reference from *Mean Girls* (2004), it leverages humor to make governance less intimidating and more inclusive.

Stakeholders impacted:
- **DReps:** Encouraged to participate visibly in the weekly tradition.
- **Community Members:** Gain a relatable cue for identifying and engaging with DReps.
- **Intersect and Governance Bodies:** Offered a case study on voluntary soft-norm enforcement.

This proposal aligns with Cardano’s principle of *pluralism through participation* — even when the participation involves fashion.

## Specification

### Rule

- On Wednesdays, DReps are encouraged (and symbolically mandated) to wear something pink.  
- The rule applies globally across time zones.  
- Compliance is self-reported via optional social media photos or metadata tags (e.g., `#PinkForParticipation`).  
- Exceptions apply where cultural or personal preference dictates otherwise; participation remains voluntary in spirit.

### Enforcement

- No on-chain enforcement will occur.
- The norm is upheld through community observation, memes, and friendly reminders.

### Metadata Tagging

An optional metadata field may be added to DRep identifiers:
\`\`\`
"dr_rep_attire": {
  "wednesday": "pink"
}
\`\`\`

## Rationale: How does this CAP achieve its goals?

This CAP demonstrates how soft governance tools — humor, ritual, and culture — can strengthen social capital in decentralized systems. By framing governance participation in accessible and creative ways, DReps can appear more human, fostering trust and engagement among ADA holders.

Alternative approaches (e.g., requiring standardized profile pictures or formal public statements) were rejected as overly rigid. “Wearing pink” offers an inclusive, light-touch model for cultural bonding without bureaucratic complexity.

## Path to Ratification

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Discussed broadly within the community and received at least three meme submissions.
- [ ] Gained voluntary participation by 51% of active DReps on one Wednesday.
- [ ] Recognized by Intersect as a cultural milestone in governance.

### Implementation Plan

1. Publish CAP-0002 and announce on community channels.  
2. Coordinate initial “Pink Wednesday” with DRep and community promotion.  
3. Evaluate engagement levels through social metrics and memes produced.  
4. Review and document insights for future cultural governance initiatives.
